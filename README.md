# 𝕋𝕠𝕟𝕒𝕝𝕒𝕞𝕒𝕥𝕝: Talking Book : Nahuatl-Maya Sacred Calendar System

### This project is titled for the sacred talking book of ritual workings 

### This project is dedicated to the study of Tonalpohualli, the Sacred Ritual Count of 260-Days


### This project is dedicated to Nahuatlatolli, to Xochitlcuicatl
my prayer is a blossom from Truth, petals of sacred meaning draw Divine Breath and respirate


### this project is dedicated to participatory preservation and veneration of Our Sacred and Ancestral Ways:

with great respect and gratitude to my Ancestors and our contemporaries:

### The Maize and Milpa Peoples; Maya, Mexica, Nahua, Pueblo, Laguna, Plains, & +


*... diverse, beautiful, daring, intellectual, artistic, farming, dreaming peoples ...*

*... with love for the land, weather, spirits, stars, and all my relations ...*

*... from the Place of Seven Caves, the Twisted Gourd, Sacred Cenotes ...*

*... Lake Atitlán, from where the rainbow got its colors ...*

## *tlazocamati!*


we are not artifacts! we are living, remembering, participatory kin - each with a unique identity, purpose, and path.

This Tonalamatl project is conceptualized as an experimental calendrical counter, cosmic signal processor, Tonalpohualli study tool, and ceremonial calculator with modern, modular computation.
This project attempts to describe temporal, geographic, and spiritual awareness as an interconnected, dynamic, self-validating system where every day has the signature of its formulation (derived paradoxically) from calendrical calculations like hollow points, vectors, or operators within systems of stable, obligate mutualism (resonance).

### Project Essence
* Anchors time using 1-Coatl / the Fall of Tenochtitlan / Mayan Long Count to anchor Julian and Xiuhpohualli, but could be calibrated for any calendar alignment
* Applies harmonic resonance and prime factorization to each day "print" for validation and analysis
* Builds modular, interactive counters using nodes, local-webs-and-bridges, dots, bars, and shells as digital structures
* Post-process validation: truth emerges through process, not arbitrary rules
* priorizing emergent, self-sustaining logic and inspired by cellular automata and indigenous knowledge systems

Features and Philosophy

* Ordinal day-counting: maya long count bridges Xiuhpohualli, Julian, and Gregorian in continuous date stream
* Vigesimal (base-20), proportional measurements, harmonic primes, radial logic: indigenous and relational
* Drag & Drop Interface: Modular components for day-signs, numerals, harmonic validators, etc
* Open, Sovereign, Decolonial: No dependence on the Gregorian paradigm; designed for adaptability, respect, and community sovereignty
