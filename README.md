# 𝕋𝕠𝕟𝕒𝕝𝕒𝕞𝕒𝕥𝕝: Talking Book : Nahuatl-Maya Sacred Calendar System
This project is titled for the sacred talking book of ritual calendar workings 
used by ancient and contemporaries alike of the Maya, Mexica, Nahua, Pueblo, &+ peoples.

It is conceptualized as an experimental calendrical counter, cosmic signal processor, Tonalpohualli study tool, and ceremonial calculator with modern, modular computation.
This project attempts to describe temporal, geographic, and spiritual awareness as an interconnected, dynamic, self-validating system where every day has the signature of its formulation, and is calculated like a hollow point or vector of resonance within the cosmic/relational web of existence.

Project Essence
vigesimal systems, harmonic mathematics, principles of teotl:

* Anchors time using 1-Coatl / the Fall of Tenochtitlan for temporal sovereignty and precision
* Applies harmonic resonance and prime factorization to each day for validation and cosmic coherence
* Builds modular, interactive calendars from dots, bars, and shells—translating cosmic principles into living digital structures
* Embraces post-process validation: truth emerges through process, not arbitrary rules
* Fosters emergent, self-sustaining logic—inspired by cellular automata and indigenous knowledge, not imposed external frameworks

Features and Philosophy

Ordinal day-counting: maya long count bridges Xiuhpohualli, Julian, and Gregorian in continuous date stream

Vigesimal (base-20), proportional measurements, harmonic primes, radial logic: indigenous and relational 

Drag & Drop Interface: Modular components for day-signs, numerals, harmonic validators, etc

Open, Sovereign, Decolonial: No dependence on the Gregorian paradigm; designed for adaptability, respect, and community sovereignty
